This repository contains the Node-RED flow used in the study:
"Enhancing Industrial Automation in Industry 4.0: Integrating Node-RED with Real PLCs for Analog and Digital Signal Simulation."

## Description
The flows implements analog and digital signal simulation and communication with a real PLC using Node-RED.

## Requirements
- Node-RED Platform 
- Ethernet connection to PLC (Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1400)

## Usage
Import the JSON file into Node-RED to reproduce the signal simulation environment described in the article.

## License
